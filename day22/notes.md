# Day 22: Slam Shuffle

[Problem description](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22)

## Running the program
```
# Installation: https://dart.dev/get-dart#install-using-apt-get
dart sol.dart
```

## Language
[Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language))

## Notes
First part can be done by simulation (which is how I did it).

The second part is pure math. Don't really have the time to do a write up
this time, but maybe I'll come back to this some time later (but probably
not).

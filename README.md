# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the problems of Advent of Code 2019.

This year I decided to challenge myself and try to use a different programming
language each day. In retrospect, this was probably the wrong year to do this
challenge because of the IntCode puzzles, which were presented every second
day, since it wasn't trivial to reuse my code from previous days. I had two
options: either reimplement the interpreter every two days or think of something
more clever. I ended up creating an executable of my interpreter and using
it on other days by actually spawning a process with the interpreter and
interacting with it through some other piece of code. I think it turned out just
fine and I only needed to reimplement the interperter on one day instead of like
ten.

Here's the final list of languages that I used for each day:

1. Rockstar
2. Perl
3. Fim++
4. Lisp
5. OCaml
6. Pike
7. Pascal
8. Prolog
9. C
10. Haskell
11. F#
12. Elm
13. Groovy
14. Rust
15. Java
16. R
17. PHP
18. C++
19. Erlang
20. Lua
21. SpringScript / by hand
22. Dart
23. C#
24. JavaScript
25. Python

Overall I think this was probably my favorite AoC so far, mainly because of the
IntCode challenges, as I was constantly impressed with what the creator of AoC
was able to do with such a seemingly simple language.

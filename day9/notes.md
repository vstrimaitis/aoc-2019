# Day 9: Sensor Boost

[Problem description](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9)

## Running the program
```
./compile.sh
./intc in
```

## Language
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

## Notes
There's not much to write this time, since this task was only a
small extension to the already existing IntCode interpreter.
Since an IntCode puzzle appears every second day, I decided to
sacrifice one of the languages that I know pretty well (C) to
write the final version of the IntCode interpreter. I chose C
mainly because it's fast and I don't want my IntCode interpreter
to become a bottleneck in future challenges. I will try to use
the compiled program in the future challenge so I don't have to
rewrite the interpreter each time. Not sure if it'll work fine,
but I'll just have to try it and see.
